This repository was extracted from a larger internal project at
[Esper](https://esper.com).
We released it in the hope that it might be useful to other
OCaml developers.

It won't build as is but most of the code was used in production.

Description
-----------

OCaml/Lwt implementation of pools of reusable items (typically connections), 
growing to a configurable capacity.
